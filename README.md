#### FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects #4: Build a Technical Documentation Page
---
- [Project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)
- Head over to [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Chung-Songyu/full/WNrGvgx) to see what this project looks like

** Note: FCC testing-related code/files/scripts/npms are not included in this repo.

** Note 2: Instead of being a technical documentation page, this project has been redesigned into an event calendar that still meets the project requirements
